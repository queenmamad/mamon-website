<h2><font face="Goudy Old Style">Panther Characteristics</u></font></h2>
<h3><font face="Cambria"><p>The Panther weighs from 79 to 350 pounds, or 36 to 160 kilograms, and measures around 4 to 9 feet from head to tail. It 
often ranges in hue from dark brown to black. Panthers have lengthy bodies and tail covered in black, glossy hair. They don't have any markings, but 
they do have very hard to notice black rosettes. Their legs are quite strong, and their hind legs are longer and larger than their front legs. They 
have strong teeth, rounded ears, strong jaws, small head, and emerald green eyes. In addition to being one of the biggest cats in the world, the 
panther also has the ability to roar, something other cats do not.</p></font></h3>
<h2><font face="Goudy Old Style">Panther Habitat</u></font></h2>
<h3><font face="Cambria"><p>Panthers are amazingly adaptable animals that live in a variety of habitats. Marshlands, swamps, and grasslands are all 
suitable habitats for panthers. They can also be found in difficult environments like deserts and mountains. The Panther is nearly invisible at night 
thanks to its ability to blend into the surrounding vegetation thanks to its black hue. Panthers frequently inhabit and hunt in trees. They conceal 
themselves in tree branches before attacking their victim from there. In the cat family, panthers are regarded as the best tree climbers. They may 
ascend to a hight of 18 feet. They are quick and extremely intelligent. The panther can run as fast as 114 kph (71 mph).</p></font></h3>
<h2><font face="Goudy Old Style">Panther Diet</u></font></h2>
<h3><font face="Cambria"><p>Panthers are carnivorous, or meat-eating, creatures. Herbivores like deer, wild pigs, and wild boars make up the majority 
of their diet. They also consume livestock and other small creatures including fishes, dogs, birds, and rabbits. They will consume practically 
anything that moves as long as it isn't too large or powerful. Other large carnivores, like lions and hyenas, occasionally hunt on panthers. Humans 
pose the greatest threat to all panthers amd are the most frequent predators. Deforestation and the degradation of their natural habitat are 
additional threats to them.</p></font></h3>
<h2><font face="Goudy Old Style"Panther Behavior</u></font></h2>
<h3><font face="Cambria"><p>Due to their extraordinary quietness and vigilance, panthers are rarely spotted by strolling humans. Panthers are 
nocturnal creatures as well. They do most of their hunting at night and relax a lot of the morning in the woods. Panthers are strong and courageous 
animals. They are also quite hostile, which makes both people and other animals afraid of them. The panther will chomp its victim by attacking its 
neck with its strong jaws. Panthers signal their presence with scratches or vocalizations. Most intruders are deterred from entering black panther 
territory by scent marking, such as urine or feces surrounding their territory, and signals.</p></font></h3>
