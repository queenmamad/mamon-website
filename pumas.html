<h2><font face="Goudy Old Style">Puma Characteristics</font></h2>
<h3><font face="Cambria"><p>After the lion, leopard, jaguar, and tiger, the puma cat is the fourth heaviest of the New World cats in terms of weight. 
Pumas are slim, swift cats that reach a length of 2.4 meters (8 feet) from nose to tail (their tails are 80 centimeters or 33 inches long). At the 
shoulder, they stand between 60 and 76 centimeters (2 and 2.5 feet) tall and weigh between 34 and 48 kilograms (75 and 105 pounds) for females and 
53 to 72 kilograms (115 and 160 pounds) for males. Pumas have simple, solid-colored fur that might be tawny, silver grey, or reddish brown in color. 
On ther underparts, including the jaws, chin, and throat, pumas have lighter patches. Pumas have erect ears and a round head. To help them catch 
prey, their front legs are larger than their back legs. They have 4 retractable claws on the hind paws, 1 dew claw, and 5 retractable claws on the 
forepaws. Pumas have powerful jaws and a musculosketal neck. Pumas are formidable hunters because of their keen hearing and superb vision. The name 
of a male puma is simply a "puma," that of a female is a "she-puma," and that of the young is "cubs."</p></font></h3>
<h2><font face="Goudy Old Style">Puma Habitat</font></h2>
<h3><font face="Cambria"><p>The Puma has a wide range of habitats. Although it may survive in wide plains, coniferous and tropical woods, swamps, and 
deserts, it favors settings with dense underbrush and rocky terrain for stalking.</p></font></h3>
<h2><font face="Goudy Old Style">Puma Diet</font></h2>
<h3><font face="Cambria"><p>The puma hunts a range of animals as a carnivorous stalker and ambush predator. Ungulates including deer, horses, elk, 
cattle, and sheep make up their primary diet. In essence, the puma will consume any animal that it can capture, even ones as large as mooses. Pumas 
will chase their prey through bushes, trees, and across ledges of rock before springing onto the back of their prey and biting them in the neck to 
suffocate them. This killing method requires the puma's nimble spine. The puma is known to cover large victims when it kills them with bushes before
returning to feast over several days. They supplement their diets with tiny rodents and huge insects.</p></font></h3>
<h2><font face="Goudy Old Style">Puma Behavior</font></h2>
<h3><font face="Cambria"><p>Territories of puma cats depend on the terrain, vegetation, and availability of food. Male territories, which can range 
in size from 58 to 386 square miles, are typically half as large as female territory. Feces, urine, and scrape marks are utilized by females to mark
their territory and attract potential mates. To mark their territory, males may assemle a tiny mound of grasses and leaves and then urinate on it. 
Pumas will only gather in packs with their mothers and the young. Pumas only gather as adults to breed. Crepuscular and most active at dawn and 
twilight, wolves are known as pumas. Pumas are vocal cats with distinctive low-pitched hisses, growls, purrs, and screams that are well-known. Pumas 
can leap extremely high, up to 5.4 meters (18 feet), as they largest hind legs in the cat family. The length of a horizontal jump can range from 20 
to 40 feet, or 6 to 12 meters. Despite being best suited for quick, forceful sprints, they are extremely fast cats and can run at speeds of 35 mph. 
Pumas are also strong swimmers and skilled climbers. </p></font></h3>
