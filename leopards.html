<h2><font face="Goudy Old Style">Javan Leopard</font></h2>
<img src="/website/Javan Leopard.jpeg" style="float:right" height="200" width="300">
<h3><font face="Cambria"><p>Java is home to the critically endangered Javan leopard <i>(Panthera pardus melas)</i>, which is only found there. Due to 
a recessive trait, the leopards are either entirely black or have the typical spotty coat. Only around 250 Javan leopards remain in their range in 
their range in protected environments, making them one of the most endangered cats in the world. The population of Javan leopards has dropped 
dramatically as a result of habitat loss, poaching, habitat depletion, discordance with humans, and dwindling prey sources.</p></font></h3>

<h2><font face="Goudy Old Style">Amur Leopard</font></h2>
<img src="/website/Amur Leopard.jpeg" style="float:right" height="200" width="300">	
<h3><font face="Cambria"><p>A severly endangered subspecies of leopard is the Amur leopard, often known as the Far Eastern leopard <i>(Panthera pardus 
orientalis)</i>. The animal is indigenous to northeast China and southeastern Russia. There are currently just about 70 Amur leopards left in the 
world, according to WWF data. Their thick, spot-covered coat, which is necessary for survival in the chilly region where these leopards inhabit, sets 
these creatures apart from other subspecies of leopards. Threats to the Amur leopard populations include eroaching human habitations, poaching, 
building of highways through leopard habitat, forest fires, illnesses, and inbreeding.</p></font></h3>

<h2><font face="Goudy Old Style">Persian Leopard</font></h2>
<img src="/website/Persian Leopard.jpeg" style="float:right" height="200" width="300">
<h3><font face="Cambria"><p>The largest subspecies of leopard, known as the Persian or Caucasian leopard <i>(Panthera pardus ciscaucasica)</i>, is 
indigenous to the Caucasus Mountains, where it can be found in Turkmenistan, Azerbaijan, Iran, and western Afghanistan. The Persian leopard is 
regarded as endangered by the IUCN. There are only 871 to 1,290 mature members of this subspecies now known to exist. According to a study done in 
Iran between 2007 and 2011, unlawful hunting and poisoning were to blame for over 70&#37; of the Persian leopards' deaths. 18&#37; of the fatalities 
were caused by traffic accidents.</p></font></h3>

<h2><font face="Goudy Old Style">African Leopard</font></h2>
<img src="/website/African Leopard.jpeg" style="float:right" height="200" width="300">
<h3><font face="Cambria"><p>A subspecies of leopard that is exclusive to the continent of Africa is called the African leopard <i>(Panthera pardus 
pardus)</i>. Although widespread throughout sub-Saharan Africa, the historical range of the African leopard has been severely fragmented. African 
leopards can have coats that are light yellow, black, deep gold, or tawny in color. There are accounts of the harmful effects of trophy hunting on 
leopard populations and social lives, and African leopards are casualties of this industry. Leopard populations close to populated areas have 
suffered greatly from bushmeat hunting, as well.</p></font></h3>
