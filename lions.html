<h3><font face="Cambria"><p>The Kantaga lion <i>(Panthera leo bleyenberghi)</i>, commonly known as the Southwest, is one of the several species of 
lions and has unique traits. It is possible for this huge lion subspecies to weigh up to 280 kilos. When it comes to appearance, the Kantaga lion 
stands out for having a distinctive, imposing mane that is sand in color. Light brown and coffee-colored variations of the mane's outermost region 
are possible.</p></font></h3>

<h2><font face="Goudy Old Style">Transvaal Lion</font></h2>
<img src="/website/Transvaal Lion.jpeg" style="float:right" height="200" width="300">
<h3><font face="Cambria"><p>South Africa is home to the <i>Panthera leo krugeri</i>, also known as the Transvaal lion. This African lion, a species 
from the continent's southern region, is regarded as the Kantaga lion's sibling. Male Transvaal lions can grow as long as 2 meters and 
50 centimeters. Even though their fur is typically sand-colored, this breed occasionally produces white lions. A recessive gene causes white fur to 
develop, thus white lion is a mutation of the krugeri. White lions are vulnerable in the wild despite their obvious beauty, especially since their 
pale coloring makes them impossible to conceal on the savanna.</p></font></h3>

<h2><font face="Goudy Old Style">Asiatic Lion</font></h2>
<img src="/website/Asiatic Lion.jpeg" style="float:right" height="200" width="300">
<h3><font face="Cambria"><p>Although it is now present in zoos and reserves around the globe, the Asiatic lion <i>(Panthera leo persica)</i> is 
indigenous to India. This species of lion is smaller than other lion species, has a lighter coat, and the males have a reddish mane. Due to habitat 
loss, hunting, and competition with other animals living in their area, the Asiatic lion is one of the lion species that are currently in risk of 
going extinct.</p></font></h3>

lion <i>(Panthera leo azandica)</i>, commonly known as the central African lion. The dimensions of the Congo lion range from 2 meters and 
50 centimeters. Additionally, this lion subspecies has a weight range of 150-190 kilograms. Male Congo lions are distinguished from other lion
