<h2><font face="Goudy Old Style">Jaguar Characteristics</font></h2>
<h3><font face="Cambria"><p>Jaguars are tan cats with black patterns that are visible all over their bodies. Their underbelly is white, and their 
basic color is a tan/orange hue. On their undersides, they have solid black patterns, and on their backs, they have "hollow" black circles. They have 
four powerful legs, big eyes, and a longtail that helps them balance while hunting. They also have big fangs.</p></font></h3>
<h2><font face="Goudy Old Style">Jaguar Habitat</font></h2>
<h3><font face="Cambria"><p>Jaguars are most usually observed in swampy, deep rainforests. This might be a result of preference and shyness, or it 
might be related to rapid development of dry environments through its range. Although they have been sighted in grasslands, subtropical woods, and 
deciduous forests, jaguars are more frequently found close to water sources and in rainforests.</p></font></h3>
<h2><font face="Goudy Old Style">Jaguar Diet</font></h2>
<h3><font face="Cambria"><p>Jaguars and all cats are obligate carnivores, which means they can only maintain good health on a diet consisting solely 
of meat. Jaguars are thought to prey on 87 different kinds of animals, making them incredibly opportunistic feeders and not choosy at all. Deer, 
small caimans, tapirs, dogs, capybaras, peccaries, armadillos, birds, frogs, fishes, monkeys, and turtles are just a few examples of the prey 
species.</p></font></h3>
<h2><font face="Goudy Old Style">Jaguar Behavior</font></h2>
<h3><font face="Cambria"><p>Jaguars stalk and ambush their prey rather than running after it to catch it. Jaguars will stalk until they are close 
enough to chase and kill their prey after listening for it. They frequently sever the vertebrae of more dangerous species to render it immobile 
before killing it, or they employ a throat bite to suffocate victims. Jaguars occasionally kill prey using a technique that is distinct from other 
cats. The jaguars will use their strong teeth to pierce their prey's skulls, killing them by puncturing the brain. The prey will then be dragged to a 
more remote area where they may feed.</p></font></h3>
