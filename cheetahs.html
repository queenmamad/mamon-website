<h2><font face="Goudy Old Style">Tanzanian Cheetah</font></h2>
<img src="/website/Tanzanian Cheetah.jpeg" style="float:right" height="200" width="300">
<h3><font face="Cambria"><p>East Africa is home to the Tanzanian cheetah, sometimes known as the Kenyan cheetah or the East African cheetah 
<i>(Acinonyx jubatus raineyi)</i>. The savannahs and grasslands of Tanzania, Uganda, Somalia, and Kenya are home to this cheetah subspecies. The 
second largest cheetah population is found in Tanzania. However, in the three nations of Burundi, Rwanda, and the DRC, these species have become 
regionally extinct. It is the largest subspecies of cheeta, with a head-to-body length of 110 to 135 cm. The second palest subspecies is this one. 
The coat can range in color from white to yellowish white to tan. The majority of the cat's body is coveres in numerous round, black spots, with the 
exception of its white bottom. The four to fourteen dark rings formed by these spots mix together at the tail end to form a white tuft.

<h2><font face="Goudy Old Style">Sudan Cheetah</font></h2>
<img src="/website/Sudan Cheetah.jpeg" style="float:right" height="200" width="300">
<h3><font face="Cambria"><p>Sudan cheetahs <i>(Acinonyx jubatus soemmeringii)</i>, sometimes known as Somali cheetahs, Central African cheetahs, or 
Northeast African cheetahs, are found in savannahs, grasslands, deserts, and arid regions of Central and Northeast Africa. In many areas of their 
habitat, the population is dispersed, and in Sudan, they are practically extinct. The IUCN has categorized these cheetahs as Vulnerable due to 
habitat loss and smuggling to the Middle East as threats. The Sudan cheetah looks very similar to the Tanzanian cheetah. The cheetah's black dorsal 
spots are more numerous and distinct than those of the Tanzanian subspecies, but they are also smaller. One the hind legs, there aren't any spots.

<h2><font face="Goudy Old Style">South African Cheetah</font></h2>
<img src="/website/South African Cheetah" style="float:right" height="200" width="300">
<h3><font face="Cambria"><p>The most common subspecies of cheetah is the South African or Namibian cheetah <i>(Acinonyx jubatus jubatus)</i>. The 
Okavango Delta's savannahs, the Transvaal grasslands, Namibia's farmlands, and the Kalahari's arid regions are all home to cheetahs. The South 
African cheetah bears a lot of harm from human activity despite having the biggest population among the other subspecies. In the DRC, Lesotho, and 
Malawi, it is now extinct. The adult male cat measures from 168 to 200 cm in lenth. The South African cheetah has a white bottom and a golden or 
brilliant yellow coat. The animal's spots are more numerous and noticeable on the face than they are on other subspecies.</p></font></h3>

<h2><font face="Goudy Old Style">Northwest African Cheetah</font></h2>
<img src="/website/Northwest African Cheetah.jpeg" style="float:right" height="200" width="300">
<h3><font face="Cambria"><p>The Northwest African cheetah <i>(Assinonyx jubatus hecki)</i>, sometimes known as the Saharan or Sengal cheetah, is a 
native of Northwest Africa. The IUCN lists it as severely endangered subspecies. In the wild, only 250 mature individuals remain. The cheetah is 
significantly different in appearance from other subspecies. The animal's shorter, virtually white-colored coat has spots that gradually change in 
color from black on the back to brown on the legs. Even tear striations are frequently absent, and the face looks almost spotless.</p></font></h3>
