<h2><font face="Goudy Old Style">Cougar Characteristics</font></h2>
<h3><font face="Cambria"><p>The cougar has a short, coarse coat and is large and lean. With the exception of the belly, which is a paler shade, it 
ranges in hue from yellowish to grayish brown. It has a yellowish throat and chest. Their lips are bordered in black, and their nose is pinkish. Its 
muzzle is black with black stripes, and the tip of its tail and the area behind its ears are also black. Adult eyes range from grayish-brown to 
golden in color. A third of their overall length is made up of their lengthy, cylindrical tail. They have short, powerful limbs with large feet that 
have five fingers on the front and five on the back.</p></font></h3>
<h2><font face="Goudy Old Style">Cougar Habitat</font></h2>
<h3><font face="Cambria"><p>Cougars can be found in a wide range of environments, including coniferous forests and wet lands, but they are typically found in 
mountainous and rocky areas. They live in caves, rock crevices, or other protected areas like overhanging banks or trees.</p></font></h3>
<h2><font face="Goudy Old Style">Cougar Diet</font></h2>
<h3><font face="Cambria"><p>In addition to deers, cougars also eat coyotes, beavers, porcupines, mice, marmots, racoons, hares, birds, and even 
grasshoppers. Cougars are hypercarnivores that primarily consume large mammals, particularly deers. They will prey on domestic animals such as pigs, 
chickens, sheep, calves, and goats.</p></font></h3> 
<h2><font face="Goudy Old Style">Cougar Behavior</font></h2>
<h3><font face="Cambria"><p>Undoubtedly, cougars are fierce. They can leap vast distances to tear their victim into pieces and they are as big as 
humans. There isn't much that can be domesticated, trained, or made safe about a cougar. They aren't gentle or amenable; no one can lure them into 
activities or make friends with them. They don't speak much, at least not vocally. Older cougars almost never communicate vocally; instead, they rely 
on body language, scent marking, and plain avoidance. Mother and cubs occasionally communicate vocally. Since they often spend the day sleeping and 
relaxing in small, concealed locations, cougars are most active between the hours of dawn and twilight.</p></font></h3>
