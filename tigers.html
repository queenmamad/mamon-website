<h2><font face="Goudy Old Style">Bengal Tiger</font></h2>

<h3><font face="Cambria"><p>The Bengal Tiger, also known as the Indian or Royal Bengal Tiger <i>(Panthera tigris tigris)</i>, is a native of the 
Indian subcontinent. The Bengal is now found in India, Bangladesh, Nepal, and Bhutan, though it historically roamed a far wider territory. The Bengal 
tiger is listed as being endangered. The largest tiger found in the wild, it is also the most well-known breed of tigers. A male Bengal tiger ranges 
weight from 397 to 569 pounds. The female weighs between 220 and 350 pounds and is smaller.</p></font></h3>

<h2><font face="Goudy Old Style">Sumatran Tiger</font></h2>
<img src="/website/Sumatran Tiger.jpeg" style="float:right" height="200" width="300">
<h3><font face="Cambria"><p>The smallest tiger subspecies, known as the Sumatran tiger <i>(Panthera tigris sumatrae)</i>, is found on the Indonesian
island of Sumatra. The fact that it exclusively inhabits an island has kept it apart from other tigers. As a result, its genetic makeup differs from 
that of its "mainland" kin. A severely endangered species, that Sumatran is. The Javan and Bali tigers, two more tiger subspecies that formerly 
roamed the same territory, are now extinct. The Sumatran tiger weighs around half that of the Bengal or Siberian. A female Sumatran tiger weighs 
between 165 pounds to 243 pounds, compared to a male's range of 220 to 310 pounds. The Sumatran has a modest physique compared to its larger cousins 
because it is substantially lighter and just slightly shorter than the Bengal or Siberian.</p></font></h3>

<h2><font face="Goudy Old Style">Malayan Tiger</font></h2>
<img src="/website/Malayan Tiger.jpeg" style="float:right" height="200" width="300">
<h3><font face="Cambria"><p>The Southern Indochinese tiger is another name for the Malayan tiger <i>(Panthera tigris jacksoni</i>, and sporadically 
<i>Panthera tigris malayensis)</i>. Southeast Asia (Burma, Thailand, and Malaysia) is where it originally came from. The Malayan tiger weighs 
between 165 and 245 pounds for females and 220 to 308 pounds for males. The number of tigers in Malaya is startlingly small. Less than 200 breeding 
adults exist worldwide, and that number is continually dropping. Due to poaching and habitat degradation, the Malayan tiger is now considered to be 
critically endangered. Similar to the Indochinese tiger, Malayan tigers'  components ae employed in a wide range of practices, from traditional 
remedies to rituals.</p></font></h3>

<h2><font face="Goudy Old Style">Siberian Tiger</font></h2>
<img src="/website/Siberian Tiger.jpeg" style="float:right" height="200" width="300">
<h3><font face="Cambria"><p>The Siberian tiger <i>(Panthera tigris altaica)</i>, often referred to as the Manchurian, Korean, Amur, or Ussurian tigers, 
is an endangered species that resides in Northern Asia (China, Russia, and Korea), but its range historically extended much farther. Although
the Siberian tiger is bigger in the wild. However, in captivity, the Siberian tiger frequently grows bigger than the Bengal. The Siberian has a huge
cranium and a broad chest. Its thick fur tends to be a less vivid shade of orange than that of other tiger subspecies, which serves to shield it from 
the severe winters of Northern Asia.</p></font></h3>
